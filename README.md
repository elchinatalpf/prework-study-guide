# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

Welcome to my coding BootCamp portfolio. I am starting from scratch with the guidance of the prework class, which provides ample opportunities to practice and experiment with new concepts. Pursuing a software development career without prior experience can be daunting, but my love for the process sets me apart and will undoubtedly make me a valuable asset in the future. This portfolio will represent the culmination of my BootCamp journey, showcasing the immense effort I have dedicated to completing it. It serves as a study portfolio, reflecting the growth and proficiency achieved through the program. There are many steps to follow but with a lot of practice will become second nature.

Badges aren't necessary, but they demonstrate street cred. Badges let other developers know that you know what you're doing. Check out the badges hosted by [shields.io](https://shields.io/). You may not understand what they all represent now, but you will in time.

## Features

If your project has a lot of features, list them here.

## How to Contribute

If you created an application or package and would like other developers to contribute to it, you can include guidelines for how to do so. The [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/) is an industry standard, but you can always write your own if you'd prefer.

## Tests

Go the extra mile and write tests for your application. Then provide examples on how to run them here.
